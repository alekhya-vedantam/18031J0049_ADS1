Is an array that is sorted in Ascending order a min-oriented heap? Why?
Ans. yes, in a way as the parent index is i and the left child index is 2i, right index vali=ue is 2i+1. As, i is greater 
therefore index of left and right child is greater thus children are always greater than parent node. If the values are equal,
then the first entered value is considered.
