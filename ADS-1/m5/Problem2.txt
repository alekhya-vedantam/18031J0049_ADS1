ACTIVITY 4:

Stack stack = new Stack();

while (!q.isEmpty())

stack.push(q.dequeue());

while (!stack.isEmpty())

q.enqueue(stack.pop());

ANS.
here let us consider a data set say, 1 2 3 4 5 6 are in the queue.
according to the code, the dequeue is done and the elements stored in the stack are: 6 5 4 3 2 1
now again pop() method is called and again the elements are entered into the queue in the order: 6 5 4 3 2 1
